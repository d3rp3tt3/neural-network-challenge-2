# Neural Network Challenge

This project includes an example model to predict whether an employee will leave a company. There are two target variables: 

* Attrition: Binary classification. Did the employee leave or not? 0 = no. 1 = yes.
* Department: Categorical classification. The name of the department, encoded with OneHotEncoder.
